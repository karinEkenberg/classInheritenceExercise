# C# Class Inheritance Example

## Overview
This is a console application demonstrating a basic example of class inheritance in C#.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two classes: `ExampleClass` and `ExampleInheritance`. 

### ExampleClass
- `ExampleClass` has a public string field `example`.
- It contains a parameterless constructor and a method called `Method` which prints "Hello there!" to the console.

### ExampleInheritance
- `ExampleInheritance` is derived from `ExampleClass` using inheritance.
- It introduces an additional public string field `inheritance`.

### Main Method
The `Main` method is the entry point of the program and is currently printing "Hello, World!" to the console. The main purpose of this example is to illustrate class inheritance, so additional functionality can be added as needed.

## Usage
Feel free to modify and expand upon this example to explore the concepts of class inheritance in C#. You can experiment with creating objects of both classes, accessing their fields and methods, and observing the inheritance relationship.

## Getting Started
To run the application:
1. Open the solution in a C# IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Visual Studio.
2. Build and run the project.
